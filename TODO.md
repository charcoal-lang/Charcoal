# To Do
- [ ] Give JS version feature parity (also make it work first)
- [ ] `Execute` operator (ok i forgot what this should do, we have `eval`
- already)
- [ ] Examples for PPCG questions 4, 7 (etc)
- [ ] Decide whether to add roll (shift string right (and maybe left))?, 
translate and more complex number things e.g. factor
- [ ] Add other operators to tutor? Introduce preinitialized variables?
- [ ] Use one charcoal instance for new charcoal (lambdafy) maybe?
- [ ] zip
- [ ] Make ASTProcessor lines <80 chars
- [ ] Make lambdas not print result if they also return it
